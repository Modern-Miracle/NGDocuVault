# Smart Contract Overview

## Introduction

The Docu smart contract system provides a comprehensive on-chain infrastructure for decentralized document verification, identity management, and access control. Built on Ethereum and following industry best practices, these contracts enable trustless document verification with privacy-preserving features through zero-knowledge proofs.

## Contract Suite

### Core Contracts

#### 1. DocuVault
The primary document management contract implementing the issuer-holder-verifier model.

**Key Features:**
- Document registration with content hash verification
- Multi-party consent management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Pausable functionality for emergency stops
- Event-driven architecture for off-chain indexing

#### 2. DidRegistry
Manages Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) following W3C standards.

**Key Features:**
- DID registration and lifecycle management
- Public key association
- DID document storage and updates
- Address-to-DID mapping

#### 3. DidAuth
Handles authentication and authorization across the system.

**Key Features:**
- Role management (Admin, Issuer, Holder, Verifier)
- Permission delegation
- Integration with other contracts
- Access control validation

#### 4. DidIssuer
Manages credential issuance by authorized entities.

**Key Features:**
- Trusted issuer registry
- Credential issuance tracking
- Revocation capabilities
- Issuer authorization validation

#### 5. DidVerifier
Handles credential and document verification.

**Key Features:**
- Verification request management
- Multi-signature verification support
- Verification result storage
- Integration with ZKP verifiers

### Zero-Knowledge Proof Verifiers

#### 1. AgeVerifier
Enables privacy-preserving age verification without revealing exact dates.

**Use Cases:**
- Age-restricted content access
- Regulatory compliance
- Privacy-preserving identity verification

#### 2. FhirVerifier
Verifies healthcare data following FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standards.

**Use Cases:**
- Medical record verification
- Healthcare credential validation
- Privacy-compliant health data sharing

#### 3. HashVerifier
General-purpose hash verification for arbitrary data.

**Use Cases:**
- Document integrity verification
- Generic proof validation
- Custom verification logic

### Supporting Contracts

#### VerifierFactory
Factory pattern implementation for deploying new verifier instances.

#### MockIssuer
Testing contract for development and integration testing.
