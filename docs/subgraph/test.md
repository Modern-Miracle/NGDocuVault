### ðŸ§  Coding Challenge (Medium Difficulty)

**Problem: Maximum Swap**

**Description:**

Given a non-negative integer `num`, return the maximum number you can obtain by swapping two digits at most once. If no swap can improve the number, return the original number.

**Example:**

- Input: `2736`
- Output: `7236`
- Explanation: Swapping the first digit (2) with the second digit (7) yields the maximum number.

**Constraints:**

- The input number is a non-negative integer less than 10^8.

**Objective:**

Implement a function that performs the optimal swap to maximize the number.

### ðŸ¤– Generative AI Integration Task (React or Angular)

**Scenario:**

You're tasked with developing a web application that utilizes a Generative AI model to provide real-time code suggestions based on user input. The application should be built using either React or Angular.

**Requirements:**

1. **Frontend Interface:**

   - A text editor where users can input code snippets.
   - A sidebar or section to display AI-generated suggestions.

2. **Integration with Generative AI:**

   - Connect to a Generative AI API (e.g., OpenAI's GPT models) to fetch code suggestions.
   - Send the user's input to the API and display the response in the suggestions section.

3. **Real-time Updates:**

   - As the user types, fetch and display updated suggestions without requiring a page reload.

4. **Error Handling:**

   - Implement error handling for API failures or network issues.
   - Display appropriate messages to the user in case of errors.

**Bonus:**

- Implement syntax highlighting in the text editor.
- Allow users to accept suggestions and insert them into their code.

**Objective:**

Demonstrate your ability to integrate a Generative AI model into a modern web application, ensuring real-time interaction and a seamless user experience.
