### Environment Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ng-docuvault.git
   cd ng-docuvault
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment files**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   cp apps/api/.env.example apps/api/.env
   cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env
   cp apps/contract/.env.example apps/contract/.env
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   - Fill in your database connection details
   - Add IPFS storage credentials (Pinata or Web3.Storage)
   - Set JWT secrets for authentication

5. **Start development environment**
   ```bash
   # Quick start (recommended for new contributors)
   ./run-simple.sh
   
   # Or manual setup for advanced development
   # See README.md for detailed instructions
   ```

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow our coding standards (see below)
   - Write tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run all tests
   pnpm test
   
   # Run linting
   pnpm lint
   
   # Check types
   pnpm check-types
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: your descriptive commit message"
   ```

5. **Push and create a pull request**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## üìù Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **Code formatting**: Use Prettier (configured in the project)
- **Linting**: Follow ESLint rules
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features and bug fixes

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat(api): add document encryption before IPFS upload
fix(web): resolve wallet connection issue with MetaMask
docs(contract): update smart contract deployment guide
test(api): add integration tests for SIWE authentication
```

### Code Style Guidelines

#### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer `const` over `let` when possible
- Use arrow functions for simple functions
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Follow the existing code patterns in each application

#### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props
- Keep components focused and small
- Use proper error boundaries

#### Smart Contracts
- Follow Solidity best practices
- Use NatSpec documentation
- Implement proper access controls
- Emit events for important state changes
- Optimize for gas efficiency

## üîç Testing Guidelines

### API Testing
```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm test              # Run all tests
pnpm test:watch        # Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
```

### Smart Contract Testing
```bash
cd apps/contract
pnpm test              # Run contract tests
pnpm coverage          # Generate coverage report
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm test              # Run component tests
```

### Test Coverage Expectations
- **New features**: Must include comprehensive tests
- **Bug fixes**: Should include regression tests
- **Critical paths**: Aim for 80%+ coverage
- **Smart contracts**: Aim for 90%+ coverage

## üìö Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Use TypeScript types for self-documenting APIs
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Document environment variables and configuration options
- Keep README files up to date

### User Documentation
- Write clear, step-by-step instructions
- Include screenshots for UI features
- Provide examples and use cases
- Consider multiple skill levels (beginner to advanced)

### API Documentation
- Document all endpoints with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Include request/response examples
- Document error responses
- Keep authentication requirements clear
