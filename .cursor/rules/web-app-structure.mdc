# Web Application Structure

The main web application is built with Next.js and follows a modular architecture.

## Core Structure

- **[apps/web/app/](mdc:apps/web/app)**: Next.js app directory with route definitions and page components
- **[apps/web/components/](mdc:apps/web/components)**: Reusable UI components specific to this application
- **[apps/web/contexts/](mdc:apps/web/contexts)**: React context providers for state management
- **[apps/web/features/](mdc:apps/web/features)**: Feature-based modules that encapsulate related functionality
- **[apps/web/hooks/](mdc:apps/web/hooks)**: Custom React hooks for shared logic
- **[apps/web/lib/](mdc:apps/web/lib)**: Utility functions and shared libraries
- **[apps/web/public/](mdc:apps/web/public)**: Static assets like images, fonts, and files
- **[apps/web/services/](mdc:apps/web/services)**: Service layer for API interactions and data fetching
- **[apps/web/types/](mdc:apps/web/types)**: TypeScript type definitions and interfaces

## Configuration Files

- **[apps/web/package.json](mdc:apps/web/package.json)**: Package dependencies and scripts
- **[apps/web/tsconfig.json](mdc:apps/web/tsconfig.json)**: TypeScript configuration
- **[apps/web/next.config.mjs](mdc:apps/web/next.config.mjs)**: Next.js configuration
- **[apps/web/components.json](mdc:apps/web/components.json)**: Component configuration
- **[apps/web/middleware.ts](mdc:apps/web/middleware.ts)**: Next.js middleware for request processing

## Key Features

- Uses the App Router pattern from Next.js
- Integrates with shared UI components from the packages/ui library
- Connects to backend API services
- Implements authentication flows
- Provides a responsive and accessible user interface

## Development Guidelines

- Feature-based organization for related components, hooks, and utilities
- Context-based state management for app-wide state
- Component-driven development with a focus on reusability
- TypeScript for static type checking throughout the application
