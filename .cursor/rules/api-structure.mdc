# DocuVault API Structure

The DocuVault API is organized into several core areas:

## Authentication
- JWT Authentication: Traditional token-based authentication
- SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum): Modern Web3 authentication flow
- Main file: [apps/api/docs/dev-docs/frontend-api-reference.md](mdc:apps/api/docs/dev-docs/frontend-api-reference.md)

## DID Operations
The API provides comprehensive Decentralized Identifier (DID) management:
- Creating DIDs
- Resolving DIDs
- Updating DID documents
- Managing DID public keys

## Error Handling
The API uses standardized error responses with specific error codes for different scenarios.

## API Response Format
- Success responses: `{ success: true, data: {...} }`
- Error responses: `{ success: false, error: { code: string, message: string, details?: any } }`
