# DID Operations

DocuVault provides comprehensive Decentralized Identifier (DID) management through these endpoints:

## Creating and Managing DIDs
- Create DID: `POST /api/v1/did`
- Resolve DID: `GET /api/v1/did/:did`
- Get DID Document: `GET /api/v1/did/:did/document`
- Update DID Document: `PUT /api/v1/did/:did`
- Update DID Public Key: `PUT /api/v1/did/:did/publicKey`
- Deactivate DID: `DELETE /api/v1/did/:did`
- Get DID by address: `GET /api/v1/did/address/:address`

## Common Operations
- Creating a DID requires an authenticated user with a wallet address
- Updating a DID document requires authentication and ownership
- DID resolution doesn't require authentication
- DID operations return standardized responses with transaction information
